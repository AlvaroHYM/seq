# embeddings -- Vocabulary files

Save here your vocabulary files, such as the ones downloaded from [https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/crawl-vectors.html](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/crawl-vectors.html).

In case you defined your own vocabulary, please imitate the format of these vocabularies:

```
<number of words>    <embeddings-length>
<word1>  <vector elements separated by white spaces>
<word2>  <vector elements separated by white spaces>
...
<wordN>  <vector elements separated by white spaces>
```

The repository needs the vocabulary file to have a `.txt` extension. Please be careful about this and rename your file accordingly.
